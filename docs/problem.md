# Problem

There was no scalable virtual card product in the platform, limiting payment flexibility and revenue opportunities.

Customers and internal stakeholders needed:
- a secure way to issue cards
- predictable lifecycle logic
- minimal manual intervention

Without this, revenue opportunities were lost and manual effort was high.
